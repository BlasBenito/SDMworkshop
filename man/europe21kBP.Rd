\description{
Raster brick with predictive variables to fit species distribution models for the European territory at ~20km resolution and reference system WGS84 (units are degrees of latitude and longitude, EPSG is 4326).
The variables are:
\itemize{
  \item \emph{bio1}: annual mean temperature (ÂºC x 10).
  \item \emph{bio2}: mean diurnal temperature range, computed as \eqn{mean of monthly (max temp - min temp)}.
  \item \emph{bio3}: isothermality, computed as \eqn{(bio2/bio7)*100}.
  \item \emph{bio4}: temperature seasonality (standard deviation of monthly averages * 100).
  \item \emph{bio5}: maximum temperature of the warmest month.
  \item \emph{bio6}: minimum temperature of the coldest month.
  \item \emph{bio7}: temperature annual range, computed as \eqn{(bio5-bio6}.
  \item \emph{bio8}: mean temperature of the wettest quarter.
  \item \emph{bio9}: mean temperature of the driest quarter.
  \item \emph{bio10}: mean temperature of the warmest quarter.
  \item \emph{bio11}: mean temperature of the coldest quarter.
  \item \emph{bio12}: annual precipitation (mm.).
  \item \emph{bio13}: precipitation of wettest month.
  \item \emph{bio14}: precipitation of driest month.
  \item \emph{bio15}: precipitation seasonality (standard deviation of monthly averages * 100).
  \item \emph{bio16}: precipitation of wettest quarter.
  \item \emph{bio17}: precipitation of driest quarter.
  \item \emph{bio18}: precipitation of warmest quarter.
  \item \emph{bio19}: precipitation of coldest quarter.

\details{
Bioclim variables (\emph{bioXX}) were downloaded from the CCSM4 model available in the \emph{Last Glacial Maximum section} of the \emph{Worldclim v1.4} dataset (Hijmans et al. 2005, \url{https://www.worldclim.org/version1}).
